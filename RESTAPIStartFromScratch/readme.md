# Create a Flask Application

In this exercise, you are starting from scratch. We would like you to create a Flask application that is essentially a CRUD application for some basic insurance claim data. 

For the data, you can use MySQL which is installed in your VM, or alternatively have the insurance data in memory, or just in a flat file. It's up to you.

Use the GenAI tool to create the whole thing. Consider:

1. Sample data
2. Project code
3. Unit Tests
4. How to run it
5. A readme file that explains how the project works and also how to run the application
