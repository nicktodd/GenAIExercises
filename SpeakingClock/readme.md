# Speaking Clock

In the old days, people used to phone a telephone number to find out what the time is.

Your task is to create an application using whichever language you prefer that replicates this capability.

It could say things like:

* It's midday
* It's midnight
* It's 1'oclock in the afternoon
* It's half past 3 in the afternoon
* It's just gone half past 3 in the afternoon

These are just examples. Your task is to create the system. 

Don't forget to consider unit tests and also the structure of the application.
