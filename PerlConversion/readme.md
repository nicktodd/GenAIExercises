# Perl Conversion

In this project we have a simple Perl script that does some kind of ETL.

A common challenge can be to migrate legacy applications to a more modern equivalent.

Create a Python equivalent of the same file, but also ensure that you have a comprehensive set of unit tests, and also ensure that your Python code is modular.
